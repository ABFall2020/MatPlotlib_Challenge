In this scenario, I have recently joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a pharmaceutical company specializing in anti-cancer medications. The company has conducted an animal study to screen potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a common form of skin cancer. The study involved 249 mice with SCC tumors who received various drug regimens, including Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin. Over a 45-day period, the development and measurement of tumor growth were observed.

As a senior data analyst, my role is to analyze the data and generate all the necessary tables and figures for the technical report of the clinical study. The primary objective is to compare the performance of Capomulin against other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked me with providing a top-level summary of the study results. This involves presenting key insights, trends, and comparisons between different drug regimens. My analysis will contribute to the decision-making process regarding the effectiveness of Capomulin in treating squamous cell carcinoma.

In summary, my responsibilities include:

Analyzing the data from the animal study.
Generating tables and figures to present relevant information.
Creating a comprehensive technical report for the executive team.
Offering a top-level summary that highlights key findings and insights from the study.
My analysis is expected to play a crucial role in informing the company's decision-making process and may influence the direction of future research and development efforts.
